As a community run project Dagger is always looking for new contributors to improve and drive the project forwards. Right now we're specifically looking for developers with **C**, **C++** and **blockchain** knowledge. 

But whether you're interested in working on **marketing**, **designing**, **programming** or something else and feel like contributing to Dagger â€” come and have a chat with us! Our team mainly communicates through [Discord](https://discord.gg/zT7DW2N), but you can message us through other channels as well.

Work done on the project is rewarded on a monthly basis from our [community fund](https://explorer.xdag.io/block/FQglVQtb60vQv2DOWEUL7yh3smtj7g1s).

Dagger began as side project of a single developer, yet soon grew to involve crypto enthusiasts from all around the world. **Join us** in creating something new and interesting in the ever-changing world of cryptocurrencies.
