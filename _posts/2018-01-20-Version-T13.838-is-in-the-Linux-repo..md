1. new hashrate counting system implemented; it is more precise than the existing one;  touched to:
   * hashrate of whole network;
   * hashrate of the node;
   * hashrate of each miner;
1. option '-a address' added; this option allow the miner operate of this specific address instead of default one.
This option is dedicated to miners who have several addresses.
   * For example, second address incidentally appears after update.
   * Another example: early solo miner with much of addresses. To use this option one need to know the address and have files wallet.dat, dnet_key.dat and the storage directory.
   * Then, run `$ xdag -d -m N -a address pool:port`
   * To know all addresses one need to run the program without -a option and type the command 'account 1000' or with larger number.
   * Then, one can see balances of these addresses in the balance viewer.
   * Note for early solo-miners: loading blocks could take a time, type the 'state' command periodically.
1. small fixes:
   * transfer to incorrect address forbidded;
   * problem with rounding of smallest digit of amount fixed;
   * files netdb\*.txt updated.

This update recommended for pools on the next planned maintenance. Miners can update if it is necessary.
